For Cloudflare Workers, consider D1 database or external PostgreSQL. Install required dependencies: sqlite3 (built-in Python) or psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL.\n\n**Step 2: Schema Design**\nCreate database schema with tables:\n- users (id, telegram_id, preferences_json, created_at, updated_at)\n- reminders (id, user_id, message, scheduled_datetime, created_at, is_completed)\n- log_entries (id, user_id, content, entry_date, created_at, tags)\n- weekly_summaries (id, user_id, week_start_date, summary_content, created_at)\n\n**Step 3: Database Connection Management**\nImplement database.py with connection pooling, transaction management, and proper error handling. Create DatabaseManager class with methods: connect(), execute_query(), execute_transaction(), close_connection(). Handle connection timeouts and retries.\n\n**Step 4: CRUD Operations Implementation**\nReplace existing storage.py functions with SQL equivalents:\n- save_reminder() → INSERT INTO reminders\n- get_reminders() → SELECT FROM reminders WHERE user_id\n- save_log() → INSERT INTO log_entries\n- get_logs() → SELECT FROM log_entries with date filtering\n- save_user_data() → INSERT/UPDATE users table\nImplement proper parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Step 5: Data Migration Script**\nCreate migrate_data.py script to:\n1. Read existing JSON/text files from storage/ directory\n2. Parse and validate data structure\n3. Transform data to match new schema\n4. Insert data into SQL tables with proper foreign key relationships\n5. Verify data integrity post-migration\n6. Create backup of original files before migration\n\n**Step 6: Configuration Management**\nAdd database configuration to environment variables: DATABASE_URL, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD. Create database initialization script for first-time setup.\n\n**Note: If specific database choice, connection pooling library, or migration strategy details are unclear, these should be determined based on deployment environment requirements and expected user load.**",
