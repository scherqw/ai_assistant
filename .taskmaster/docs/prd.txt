# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**:
  - Telegram Bot (Python/Node.js backend)
  - LLM integration (OpenAI, local LLM, etc.)
  - Canvas API client
  - Data storage (initially text files, later upgradeable)
  - Cloudflare deployment scripts/configuration
- **Data Models**:
  - User profile (Telegram ID, preferences)
  - Reminders, logs, summaries
  - Canvas course and assignment data
- **APIs/Integrations**:
  - Telegram Bot API
  - Canvas LMS API
  - LLM provider API
  - Cloudflare Workers/Pages API
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Runs on Cloudflare (Workers/Pages), with deployment scripts and guides

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP**:
  - Telegram bot with commands: /remind, /summarize, /log, /weekly
  - Basic LLM integration for summarization
  - Store reminders/logs in text files
  - Cloudflare deployment (step-by-step guide)
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Canvas API integration for course/assignment tracking
  - Automated notifications for assignments, grades, and tests
  - Improved data storage (database)
  - Multi-user support
  - Advanced deployment options (CI/CD, secrets management)

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up Telegram bot and command handling (foundation)
- Integrate LLM for summarization
- Implement reminders and logging features
- Add weekly summary generation
- Integrate Canvas API (start with data extraction and notifications)
- Add Cloudflare deployment scripts and documentation
- Refactor storage as needed

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Telegram/Canvas API changes**: Monitor for updates, use official libraries.
- **LLM cost/latency**: Start with free/affordable options, optimize prompts.
- **Data persistence**: Use text files for MVP, plan for database migration.
- **Cloudflare limitations**: Ensure compatibility with Workers/Pages, monitor for API limits.
- **Scope creep**: Focus on core features for MVP, document future ideas.
